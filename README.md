# RescueKeyShotVideoFrames
Primary use for this Photoshop script is when KeyShot fails to render video and the user did not opt to save the frames.
This creates the frames from the exr files generated by Keyshot.

How to use:
	1) Locate the .exr files in temp folders
	2) Place this script on the same path as the folder of the exr files
	3) Create a new folder where the images will be saved
	4) Open Photoshop. File -> Scripts -> Browse

	NOTES
	1) This script should be in the same folder as the source and save folders
	2) This compiles the exr channel files (rendered from KeyShot) into a single png file for each frame
	3) This script opens the following files:
		<keyshotName>.<frameNumber>"_lighting.exr"
		<keyshotName>.<frameNumber>"_gi.exr"
		<keyshotName>.<frameNumber>"_caustics.exr"
		<keyshotName>.<frameNumber>"_reflection.exr"
		<keyshotName>.<frameNumber>"_refraction.exr"
